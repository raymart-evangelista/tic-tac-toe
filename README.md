# tic-tac-toe

This tic tac toe game is revised with rspec tests as part of Assignment 1 in Ruby "PROJECT: CONNECT FOUR"  of the Odin Project. The original code I created seemed difficult for me to test. I spent hours trying to create rspec tests for my original tic tac toe code, with almost no luck of progressing. So, I listened to what was told on the Odin Project, and I decided to try refactoring my old code with updated and hopefully easier code to test on. I had a bit of trouble figuring out how to test my code, but I used the previous lessons in the "Testing Ruby with RSpec" topic to guide me. Learning how to set instance variables with object.instance_variable_set helped a lot with getting the tests to work. I started off with creating tests for methods I thought were easier to create tests for. Once I got more comfortable writing tests, I started to dabble into more difficult methods that had more meaty code such as #player_turn and #play_game. 

This stackoverflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37248095/how-can-i-mock-an-instance-variable-in-rspec also contributed to me getting a better understanding of testing.

I still feel pretty iffy with test doubles, and I don't know if using #instance_variable_set was the right way to go about testing. Overall, this was still a great experience learning how to test code with RSpec.
